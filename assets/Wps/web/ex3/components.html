<h3>Input Unit</h3>

<p>

With the use of input devices, we give data and information as input. The input unit is

made up of a variety of input devices. Some input devices are a keyboard, mouse,

microphone, scanner, etc.

</p>

<h3>Output Unit</h3>

<p>

The computer’s output unit communicates the results of processing and information to

the outside world. The Visual Display Unit (VDU), usually known as the monitor, is the

most commonly utilized output device. Other popular output devices include a projector,

headphones, speakers, etc.

</p>

<h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>

<p>

The CPU is the backbone of the computer system. All the instructions that the computer

receives from the user, or a set of instructions, are processed by this CPU.

</p>

<p>Three Major Components Of the CPU Are:-</p>

<p>

<b>Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU)</b><br>

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) work for all math and operations that are related to

arithmetical and logical operations.

</p>

<p>

<b>Central Unit (CU)</b><br>

The control unit, which coordinates and controls other functional units of the computer, is

sometimes known as the “central nervous system” of the machine. All CPU functions,

including ALU operations and data flow inside the CPU, are under the direction of CU.

</p>

<h3>Memory Unit (MU)</h3>

<p>

The memory unit is responsible for storing data and information for the computer’s other

functional components.The Memory Unit is divided into two categories:-

</p>

<p>Primary Memory<br>

The primary memory is temporary and volatile. </p>

<p>Secondary Memory<br>

Secondary memory can be used to store application programs, documents, films, audio,

databases, and so on. Data and information transmission and reception are slower than

in primary memory.
